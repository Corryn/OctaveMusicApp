# OctaveMusicApp
A music player application for Android with a focus on simple UI.  Developed for a course on HCI.  

This repository contains an Android project for Octave, a simple music player application with the ability to play music stored on your phone.  Due to the focus on minimalistic design, the only features beyond this are shuffle, repeat, and a rudimentary playlist (essentially a queue).
